**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**  
Separating the database logic in a separate CRUD Python module should make the dashboard easier to maintain. This structure let me reuse the same CRUD methods without rewriting database logic. The module could be reused in future apps or scripts that need to access the same database. The python file is a pretty basic CRUD module, that could be extended or modified in the future for a different scenario.

**How do you approach the project? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**  
By breaking down the project into small and focused steps. Here we started with database access, then building the Dash page, and finally connecting the two. 

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**  
Computer scientists turn raw data into useful tools through systems design and logic. This project helped improve the fictional company's ability to find animals for specific rescue roles.
